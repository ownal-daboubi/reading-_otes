There are three examples of image placement that produce different results:-

1 Before a paragraphThe paragraph starts on a new line after the image. 

2 Inside the start of a paragraph The first row of text aligns withthe bottom of the image. 3 In the middle of paragraph The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it appears in.

Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.
JPGs, GIFs, and PNGs belong to a type of image format known as bitmap. They are made up of lots of miniature squares.

Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.

Each extra frame of the image increases the size of the file, and can therefore add to the time it takes for an image to download (and web users do not like waiting a long time for images to download).
To write under image we use <figure>&<figcaption>.

You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
rgb values.
hex codes.
color names.

Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue.

When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.
CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.

When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it’s installed on that user’s computer.
There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
