## local Storage



Cookies can be used for local storage data of small amounts, but they have downsides like:
1- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over

2- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)

3- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data â€” enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

HTML 5 Solved this by introducing HTML5 Storage

HTML5 Storage is based on key/value pairs like objects, all data is saved as string and if you want to use any other type you have to convert like parseInt

You can treat localStorage as ab associative array.

You can also track changes to HTML5 storage area.

Limitations in current browsers are: 5 megabytes each origin gets, quota exceeded error if you exceed this 5 mb, and no if you want to ask user for more storage space.

SQL is the next step, its a web database that you can save data to, and includes statements like select, update , insert.
