Todat about the following:

Links:

Links are used to define feature of the webbecause they allow you to
move fromone web page to another â€” enabling thevery idea of browsing or surfing.

Writing links :
Links are created using the <a> element.Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.

Links are created using the <a>lement which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page thatou want people to view.

Linking to Other Pages on the Sa me Site:

Now if you are linking other pages at the same site.to do thid You can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.These are likea shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not needto specify the domain name.You can use relative URLs which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page. Also,you do not need to repeat the domain name in each link, they are also quicker to
write.


Rela tive Link Type: 

1.Same Folder
2.Child Folder
3.Grandchild Folder
4.Parent Folder
5.GrandParent Folder

Directory Structure :
ypo can organaize your code if you ae working on a larger websites by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder and folders are called directories.

Email Links:
it is used To create a link that starts up the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified email address.you use <a> and the
value of the href attribute startswith mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the email to be sent to.

Opening Links in a New Window :
target using target attribute to open in a new window.

Layout:

we need the layout to :
Controlling t XX he position of elements
Creating site layouts
Designing for different sized screens

Controlling the position of Elements:

There threee postioning schemes in css:

1.Normal flow.
2.Relative positioning.
3.Absolute positioning.

We also use Boxoffset To indicate where a box should be positioned.

1. Normal fow :each block-level element sits on top of the next one

2. Relative positioning it moves an element in relation to where it
   would have been in normal flow.


3. Absolute positioning it makes the box the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the page.

 Floating Elements:

The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible. Anything else that sits inside the containing element will
flow around the element.

creating multi-column Layouts with Floats:

The following three CSS properties are used to position the columns next to each other:

width
This sets the width of the
columns.
float
This positions the columns next
to each other.
margin
This creates a gap between the
columns.

Multiple Style Sheets:
Some authors take an even more modular approach to stylesheets, creating
separate stylesheets to control typography, layout, forms, tables, even different styles for each sub-section of a site.
There are two ways to add
multiple style sheets to a page:

1: Your HTML page can link
to one style sheet and that
stylesheet can use the @import
rule to import other style sheets.

2: In the HTML you can use a
separate <link> element for
each style sheet.


JAvascript :

There was an examle and the example there was three variables are created that store information that is used in the welcome message,
These variables are then concatenated to create the full message the user sees.

Then there was basic math is performed on numbers to calculate the cost of a sign as follows:

A variable called sign holds the text the sign will show.

A property called length is used to determine how many characters
are in the string .

The cost of the sign (the subtotal) is calculated by multiplying the
number of tiles by the cost of each one.

The grand total is createq by adding $7 for shipping.

How does pair programming work?

It works by two main roles the Driver and the Navigator. 

The Driver :
he Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.

The Navigator :
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
 
 
 Why pair program?

 1. Greater efficiency

 when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.produces higher-quality.

 2. Engaged collaboration

  the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.

3. Learning from fellow students


working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.

4. Social skills

This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. 

5. Job interview readiness

the ability to work with and learn from others and stellar communication skills are as important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.

6. Work environment readiness
Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
