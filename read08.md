CSS treets each HTML element as if it's in it's own box, either an inline or a block level box.

If a block element is nested inside another block element, then the outer box is the containing or the parent element.

You can change the layout of the page using the position property in CSS; ex: normal flow, relative positioning and absolute positioning, also to indicate where the box should be positioned we can use box offset properties.

Types of positioning: 1-normal floow 2- relative positioning, 3- absolute positioning, 5-Fixed positioning, 6- Floating element

You can use z-index if 2 elements overlap,giving you control over which element shows on top.

when using float element,its a good idea to use clear left-right-both, so it doesnt touch any elements appearing in the same element.

sometimes when you use float, the height shows as 0px, to fix that use overflow:auto and width 100%.

you can create columns of layouts using float, then specifiying a width and a margin.

Screen Sizes: everyone could have different size and resolution, most designers try to create pages around 1000 pixels wide since most users will be able to see designs this wide.

Fixed width layouts designs dont change sizes when user changes their window

Liquid layouts: they change depending on the user screen/window size.

CSS Frameworks: they provide the code for common tasks like creating layout grids.

The 960.GS CSS Framework: it provides a style sheet that you can include in your HTML code

You can add more than one CSS file using @import in the main CSS file or link element in HTML
